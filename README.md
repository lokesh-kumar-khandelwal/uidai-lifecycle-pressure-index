# Aadhaar Lifecycle Pressure Index  
UIDAI Data Hackathon 2026

## Overview
This project analyzes anonymized Aadhaar enrolment, demographic update, and biometric update datasets to identify operational pressure patterns across Indian states and districts.

The goal is to quantify lifecycle stress points in the Aadhaar ecosystem and highlight regions and time periods where infrastructure, staffing, or policy interventions may be required.

---

## Problem Statement
Aadhaar services involve multiple lifecycle events such as new enrolments, demographic updates, and biometric updates. Uneven demand across geography and time can lead to service bottlenecks and degraded citizen experience.

This project proposes a **Lifecycle Pressure Index (LPI)** to:
- Measure combined operational load
- Compare pressure across states and districts
- Identify high-risk periods and regions

---

## Data Description
The analysis uses anonymized, aggregated datasets provided for the UIDAI Data Hackathon:
- Enrolment activity
- Demographic update activity
- Biometric update activity

All raw personal or identifiable data has been excluded. Only cleaned, aggregated datasets are used
